2. **Creators and Artists**: the website caters to fellow artists and creators interested in networking, inspiration, or sharing ideas. It offers insights into my artistic journey and serves as a source of inspiration.

3. **Students and Aspiring Professionals**: The website can also be valuable to students and individuals aspiring to join the field of art, design, or development. It provides a real-life example of a creative journey and valuable resources.

The visual design of the website adopts a creative and playful approach, characterized by:

- **Fun-Looking Fonts**: The use of fonts like "MistoBook" from FontLibrary and "Lalezar" from Google Fonts adds a touch of whimsy and creativity to the design.

- **Warm Color Palette**: The choice of color codes, including #5c2325 for text and logos, #d9d9d9 for the main container's background, and #eaa993 for side containers and the heart button, reflects my personality. These warm colors create a welcoming and vibrant atmosphere on the website.

- **CSS Grid Layout**: The use of CSS Grid for the main page layout complements the design concept, allowing for precise and visually appealing content organization.
